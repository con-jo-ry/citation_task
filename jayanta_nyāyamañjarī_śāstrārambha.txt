For we do not need *śāstra* [to know] 'the dirty should bathe', or 'the hungry should eat'.

So, in this way, the Vedas, Purāṇas, and Dharmaśāstras are areas of knowledge because they have the nature of on their own showing a means for human aims.
The branches by means of analysing/explaining (vyutpādana) that are useful for [understanding] the meaning of the Veda.

### [3.2.2 mīmāṃsā]

vicāram antareṇāvyavasthitavedavākyārthānavadhāraṇāt, mīmāṃsā vedavākyārthavicārātmikā vedākhyasya karaṇasyetikartavyatārūpam anubhavantī vidyāsthānatāṃ pratipadyate. tathā ca bhaṭṭaḥ—

	dharme pramīyamāṇe tu vedena karaṇātmanā |
	itikartavyatābhāgaṃ mīmāṃsā pūrayiṣyati ||

iti.

[And] because without analysis the unestablished/properly established content of the Vedic statements cannot be determined, reflection, which has the nature of analysing Vedic statements—because it is (anu-bhū + tva/rūpa/tā in accusative) the 'how' of the instrument that is called the Veda—becomes a domain of knowledge.

ata eva saptamam aṅgam iti na gaṇyate mīmāṃsā, pratyāsannatvena vedaikadeśabhūtatvāt. vicārasahāyo hi śabdaḥ svārthaṃ nirākāṅkṣaṃ prabodhayituṃ kṣamaḥ. nyāyavistaras tu mūlastambhabhūtaḥ sarvavidyānām, vedaprāmāṇyarakṣāhetutvāt. vedeṣu hi tārkikaracitakutarkaviplāvitaprāmāṇyeṣu śithilitāsthāḥ katham iva bahuvittavyayāyāsādisādhyaṃ vedārthānuṣṭhānam ādriyeran sādhavaḥ. kiṃ vā tadānīṃ svāmini parimlāne tadanuyāyinā mīmāṃsādividyāsthānaparijanena kṛtyam iti. tasmād aśeṣaduṣṭatārkikopamardadvārakadṛḍhataravedaprāmāṇyapratyayādhāyinyāyopadeśakṣamam akṣapādopadopadiṣṭam idaṃ nyāyavistarākhyaṃ śāstraṃ śāstrapratiṣṭhānanibandhanaṃ iti dhuryaṃ vidyāsthānam. 

For this very reason, Mīmāṃsā is not counted as the seventh branch, because, in being closely connected to [the Vedas], it is as if it were a part of the Veda.
For if the Vedas are have their authority undermined by bad logic created by of logicians, how on earth could good people, whose confidence has been loosened, have respect for/care about performing the content of the Vedas, it being [only] to be achieved by the expenditure of a great deal of money and by effort and so on.
Or, when the master is then weakened, what is the use of followers of those [Vedas] who are servents who are the branches of knowledge such as Mīmāṃsa? 
Therefore, this śāstra, called Nyāyavistara, is the cause for the solid foundation [all other] śāstras, taught by Akṣapāda, capable of teaching logic that imparts firmer faith in the Vedas' validity, caused by defeating/crushing (upamarda) of all bad logicians.

And their being Vidyāsthānas is nothing but their being means for the human aims.
For *vidyā* means knowing.
And that is not knowledge of a pot and so on; rather, it is knowing of the means to human aims.
[They are] the areas, loci, of knowledge,

iti.

And those methods for thorough knowledge of human aims are direct in some cases, and by an indirect method for some.
As taught—
The Vedas, together with Purāṇa [w/ itihāsa], tarka (i.e. nyāya), mīmāṃsā, dharmaśāstra, and the [six] branches—are the fourteen supports for knowledge and for Dharma.

Elsewhere too it is taught:
The [six] branches, the four Vedas, Mīmāṃśā, Nyāya, the Purāṇas, and the Dharmaśāstra—these are the fourteen knowledges.
In the former place [i.e. in the former of the two verses], it has been referred to by the word 'tarka', and the the latter, just that śāstra is expressed by the word Nyāyavistara.

For [introducing whole passage], what kind of skill in teaching inference to Sāṅkhyās and Ārhatas (Jainas) have?
To what extent at all does their logic uphold the authority of the Veda?
Therefore, it [i.e. their logic] is not appropriate to count there here. 
Even though the Buddhists raise their necks, bold because of pride about being clever in entering the path of inference, since it is contradicted by the Vedas, how can there be mention of their logic in the middle of the *vidyāsthāna*, beginning with Vedas?

What possibility is there could there be for counting [in Vidyāsthāna] this vile logic of theirs?
Just this branch of science is counted as *ānvīkṣikī*
'Eternal *anvīkṣikī, vārtā (knowledge of agreculture etc.), and knowledge'
Subseuqnt seeing of what was seen [first] by perception and scripture is *anvīkṣā*; which is to say, inference. The science that explains this called *ānvīkṣiki*.

But if the sciences are taught to be four, then how are fourteen [sciences] shown?
This is not a contradiction.
Because the sciences of farming and justice are not worthy in the set of *vidyā*s which show all aims of men (or all men) insofar as their goals is solely what is seen; and because the three [Vedas] and philosophy are taught there [in that class], those *vidyā*s are precisely fourteen.
But if *nyāya* has as its purpose the ascertainment of authority of the Vedas, then we don't need this [*nyāya*], because it is just based on/by Mīmāṃsā established [that authority]. For in that [Mīmāṃsā], like deliberation on the meaning, deliberation on authority too is indeed accomplished.
For these sciences have different procedures; and that [mīmāṃsā] is the science for the meaning of sentences; it is not science for *proof*. 
And the Mīmāṃsakas are not skilled in observing the path capable of defending the authority of the Vedas.
We will show that they are, as is well known, lost on an [invalid] apparent path whose movement is obsctructed by a heap of thorns of bad logic.
For, even direct perception and others do not have (√bhaj) the state of being pramāṇas without firmness of agreement with other *pramāṇa*s.
How much less this word [pramāṇa], whose functioning is dependent on those [perception and so on]?
For for words, when assisted by convention, merely being a knower is independent. 
However, for the determination the truth or the opposite of the meaning [of what the word conveys], its [i.e. testimony's] dependence on the person [who speaks it].
Therefore, testimony becomes a source of knowledge only because it is spoken by an authority. 
And that is to be explained in none other than this science.

[Question]: Before Akṣapāda, how was there an ascertainment of authority of the Vedas?
Right from the beginning of creation, these sciences, like the Vedas, have been active.
However, [knowledgable people] call various people (tān tān) the 'makers' with respect to various [vidyās] with respect to their desire to express that in brief or in detail.

[Objection:] Knowledable people regard the validity of the Vedas as established only without investigation; therefore, what here is the use of investigation?
That's not the case, for the [teaching of] the śāstra is begun for one whose understanding is in doubt or mistaken regarding the authority of the Vedas.
For it is not for those who have already understood the meaning of the Vedas that the Mīmāṃsā is begun [to be taught].
The making of a commentary on the sūtras is not held to be for those who know the Vedas from another source.

There are four types of people: some may be ignorant, some in doubt, some mistaken, and some certain in their knowledge [of the truth].
Of these, this sage who is certain in his knowledge produces knowledge for the ignorant with by means of this Śāstra; he removes doubts for those in doubt; and he eliminates mistakes for the mistaken. 
And how did this sage also become beomc certain in his knowledge.
The starting point is that he is certain in his knowledge.
But let him become [such] through the power of asceticism, through the worship fo a deity, or through the study of another text.

To this there may be the following [objection]: From just this other śāstra, there may be realization of reality even for people such as us; so, what is the use of the śāstra composed by Akṣapāda?
This has been refuted, because insofar as one may desire to express in brief or in detail, the composition of a śāstra is fruitful.
